I worked as a software engineer since 2009, and all through these years I mainly focused on doing device driver and virtualization development based on open source software. I have experience on:
* Products: Switch, FW, ADC, Mainframe
* CPU: MIPS, x86, Z
* OS: Linux, FreeBSD
* Hypervisor: OpenXen, KVM

I worked with my coworkers and the community making vfio-ccw upstreamed in 2017. Then I took the co-maintainer role of vfio-ccw in the Linux Kernel counterpart. Other than writing code, I tried to give back to the community by reviewing the others' code.

I enjoy doing technical work, and I think open source is cool.
